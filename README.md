# Sudan GoldMapper

💡 Sudan GoldMapper is a geospatial AI platform that integrates:
- Satellite imagery (NDVI, Iron Oxide, Clay minerals)
- Terrain analysis (Slope)
- Machine Learning (Random Forest)

🎯 Objective:
To help identify unexplored zones in Sudan with high gold mineralization potential, using science-backed AI modeling and geological indicators.

🛠️ Built With:
- React + Leaflet for frontend mapping
- Google Earth Engine for remote sensing
- Gemini AI for insight generation
- TypeScript, TailwindCSS

📍 Known deposit coordinates from real geological records are used to train the model.

🔬 Inspired by remote sensing, mineral alteration mapping, and AI-based exploration support.
